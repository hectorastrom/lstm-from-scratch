# LSTM from scratch

Implementing an LSTM with no external Python libraries used.

Goals: 
- Keep implementation <100 lines for forward pass
- No external Python libraries (e.g. numpy, torch)

Requirements:
- uv

Use `uv run main.py`

> As a quick litmus test: can you implement the forward pass of an LSTM without importing anything? 
> If not or if the implementation you just thought of would be >100 lines,
